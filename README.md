# Calculator
These are just some Python programs I have made for my TI-84 Plus CE!

**Note:**
The calculator needs to be a TI-84 Plus CE with Python.

# Usage
Download the [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/84ceupdate) app. <br /> <br />
Make sure that your calculator is plugged into your computer. <br /> <br />
Once downloaded and opened, open the third icon on the left bar. (It looks like three boxes) <br /> <br />
You can then drag files into the file list to be sent to your calculator.
